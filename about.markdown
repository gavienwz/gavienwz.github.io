This is my github blog documentating my journey as an Embedded Systems Engineer starting from my first job (since September 2024).

This will mainly serve as a notebook for all the topics that I have learned, which I can look back on whenever. I also hope that this can serve as a starting point for other aspiring Embedded Systems Engineer that are looking to learn these concepts from scratch as I have.

When I started learning about Embedded Systems with little to no knowledge about it, it was quite hard knowing where to even start at. Although there are many documents and manuals online, and many online would also recommend reading them to start understanding the topic, it definitely was quite intimidating and sometimes unproductive as someone who learns better through application.
