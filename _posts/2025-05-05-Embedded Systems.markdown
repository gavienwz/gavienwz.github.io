## About
An embedded system is a specialized computer system designed to perform a dedicated functionâ€”often as part of a larger device. Unlike general-purpose computers (like desktops or laptops), embedded systems are tightly integrated with hardware, and optimized for specific tasks like controlling sensors, managing communication, or automating a process.

They typically run real-time or lightweight operating systems, and often operate with limited memory, processing power, and power consumption.

## Examples of Embedded Systems
Routers -> Embedded Linux (Openwrt)
IoT Devices -> RTOS (FreeRTOS/Zephyr) or Embedded Linux
Industrial Sensor Node -> RTOS or Embedded Linux
